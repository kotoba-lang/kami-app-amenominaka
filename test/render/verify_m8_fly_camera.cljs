  "M8 (ADR-2607100100) real-browser fly-camera verification, run via nbb
  FROM THIS REPO'S ROOT:
    nbb -cp test/render test/render/verify_m8_fly_camera.cljs
  Loads the shadow-cljs-compiled `public/shell.html` in a full (non-
  headless-shell) Chromium via Playwright and asserts, against the REAL
  live app — no mocks:
    1. Initial camera mode is \"orbit\" (via `#debug-state`, same idiom as
       M2/M4/M5's `#out`/`#debug-state`).
    2. Clicking `#toggle-camera-mode` switches to \"fly\" and back to
       \"orbit\" — both directions, both reflected in `#debug-state`.
    3. Holding a real `w` key down (Playwright's `page.keyboard.down`/
       `up`, a genuine `keydown`/`keyup` pair — not a synthetic state
       mutation) for a real span of wall-clock time actually moves
       `:fly :pos` in `#debug-state` — proving the requestAnimationFrame-
       driven movement loop (`fly-loop!`/`move-fly!`) is real and
       framerate-driven, not just a per-event delta.
    4. The movement is also visible in the actual rendered frame —
       compared via two REAL Chromium screenshots (`page.screenshot`,
       clipped to `#viewport`) taken before/after, not JS canvas pixel
       readback (found unreliable for a WebGPU-context canvas in this
       Chromium build, see verify_m2_render's docstring)."
