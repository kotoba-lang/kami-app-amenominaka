  "M7 (ADR-2607100100) real-browser glTF-export verification, run via nbb
  FROM THIS REPO'S ROOT:
    nbb -cp test/render:../org-khronos-gltf/src:../org-khronos-glb/src test/render/verify_m7_gltf.cljs
  Loads the shadow-cljs-compiled `public/shell.html`, clicks the real
  \"Export glTF\" button (`#export-gltf`), captures the REAL browser
  download it triggers (Playwright's `download` event — the button does a
  genuine `Blob`+`<a download>` click, not a mock), reads the downloaded
  `.glb` bytes off disk, and parses them with `org-khronos-gltf`'s own
  `gltf/parse-gltf` to assert real structural correctness — not just
  \"a file got saved\", but that it's an actually-valid, actually-
  decodable glTF document with the expected node/mesh shape for the
  app's sample building (same fixture `kotoba.amenominaka.ui`'s
  `sample-building` and the JVM `gltf-export-test` both use: one wall,
  one storey/building/site/project node each, 24 real mesh vertices)."
