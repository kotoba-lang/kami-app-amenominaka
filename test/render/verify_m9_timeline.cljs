(ns verify-m9-timeline
  "M9 (ADR-2607100100) real-browser omni.timeline (camera-path) real-
  browser verification, run via nbb FROM THIS REPO'S ROOT:
    nbb -cp test/render test/render/verify_m9_timeline.cljs
  Loads the shadow-cljs-compiled `public/shell.html` in a full (non-
  headless-shell) Chromium via Playwright and asserts, against the REAL
  live app — no mocks:
    1. Initial state: 0 keyframes, playhead 0.0.
    2. Clicking `#record-keyframe` from the default orbit view, then
       switching to fly mode and holding a real `d` keydown (strafe) to
       move to a genuinely different position before recording a second
       keyframe, produces 2 keyframes 2.0s apart (kotoba.amenominaka.
       timeline's auto-spacing) — confirmed via `#debug-state`.
    3. Scrubbing `#timeline-scrub` (set via a real DOM `.value` write +
       dispatched `input`/`change` events, since Playwright's `.fill()`
       does not support `type=range` inputs — \"Malformed value\", a real
       finding of this verification script itself) to the midpoint
       (t=1.0) actually moves the render-IR's `:eye` to the arithmetic
       mean of the two recorded eyes — real linear interpolation, not
       just a UI-state change.
    4. Clicking `#toggle-play` really plays back over real wall-clock
       time (a genuine requestAnimationFrame loop, not an instant jump):
       polls until playback auto-stops at the end (`playing` -> false,
       `playhead` at the path's duration), and confirms the rendered
       frame visibly changed at least once during playback (two real
       Chromium screenshots, not JS canvas readback — see
       verify_m2_render's docstring for why).
    5. `#clear-timeline` resets keyframe count and playhead to 0.

  Every state-changing click is followed by a POLL, not a single
  immediate `#debug-state` read — React 18's automatic event-handler
  batching means a Reagent `:on-click` `swap!` doesn't necessarily flush
  to the DOM before Playwright's `.click()` promise resolves. This was
  found to be a real, intermittent (not deterministic) race by this
  script during development, the same class of bug M8's verification
  found for its camera-mode toggle — same fix (poll instead of a single
  read), applied consistently here for every click."
