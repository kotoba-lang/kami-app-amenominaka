(ns kotoba.amenominaka.ui
  "M5 (ADR-2607100100): the interactive UI shell — real environment-preset
  controls (weather/terrain/postfx/vegetation) and an orbit/zoom camera
  over the WebGPU viewport, wired to M0-M2's already-landed pipeline
  (previously only reachable via a static single-frame demo).

  M8: a second camera mode, free-fly (WASD movement + mouse-look), toggled
  alongside orbit. Needed no new `kami.webgpu.ir`/`kami.webgpu` API at all
  — `rig->camera` was always just one way to produce `:eye`/`:target`;
  [[fly-eye-target]] below computes them directly from a
  position+yaw+pitch state the same way, and `apply-camera!` only ever
  cared about the resulting `:eye`/`:target` map, not which mode produced
  it — so M4's instance-buffer cache stays hot in fly mode exactly like
  it does in orbit mode (camera-only frames never touch `:instances`).

  M9: `omni.timeline` parity (D7's own scoping — \"minimal keyframe/camera-
  path\", see `kotoba.amenominaka.timeline`'s docstring). \"Record
  Keyframe\" captures wherever the camera currently is (orbit OR fly, both
  just produce an :eye/:target the same way M8 already established) into
  an ordered path; \"Play\" drives a real requestAnimationFrame loop that
  interpolates along it and overrides the render-IR's camera each frame —
  a third, temporary camera source layered over orbit/fly (see
  [[apply-timeline-at!]]), not a third `:camera-mode` value, since
  playback is a transient override, not a persistent mode the user
  toggles the same way.

  Built on the org's DEFAULT UI/UX design system per ADR-2607022800:
  `shitsuke` (structure) + `liquid-glass-ui` (material) + `kotoba-ui`
  (single require-point) + `appkit` (desktop binding — this is a panels/
  toolbar/sliders desktop-style app, not touch/card-first, so `appkit`
  over `uikit`). This is the FIRST consumer wiring that design system to
  a WebGPU-canvas-centric app (confirmed via repo-wide grep before
  starting) — but the pattern itself (DOM chrome siblings around a
  `<canvas>` leaf node) is precedented by `kami-engine-hud`, and
  shitsuke/kotoba-ui are DOM-only by design (`liquid-glass.gpu`, true
  in-canvas glass rendering, is explicitly future work upstream) which is
  exactly the shape this app needs, not a mismatch.

  `kotoba-ui`'s `menu-select`/`button` are uncontrolled-in-React (real,
  confirmed bugs — a `<select>`/`<option>` with no `:value`/`:key` React
  props, and `button` has no `:on-click` at all, only shitsuke's SSR
  `:act` contract). [[preset-select]]/[[btn]] below are small hand-rolled
  controlled replacements with the SAME DOM shape (so the generated CSS
  still targets them correctly) — this exact workaround, including the
  DOM-shape-preservation reasoning, is copied from
  `murakumo-studio/src/murakumo_studio/ui.cljs`'s real, live-reproduced
  fix for the identical bug."
