  "M1 (ADR-2607100100): export a `kotoba.amenominaka.scene/compose` result
  to a viewable `.usda` (USD ASCII) text document, via `kotoba-lang/usd`'s
  generic USDA-from-EDN emitter (`usd.core/usda`). No new rendering engine
  — this is a pure EDN -> text-format serialization step.

  Geometry fidelity: `bim`'s `ElementGeometry` (`:brep` / `:axis-sweep` /
  `:mesh-ref` / `:none`, as carried on every `bim/element`) has no bridge
  in `bim` itself to real triangle data (confirmed by reading `bim.cljc`
  in full — its separate `SceneGeom`/`triangles-geom` scene-projection
  system is not derived automatically from `ElementGeometry` by anything
  in `bim`). This namespace computes a real box mesh ONLY for the one case
  simple enough to do honestly without building a BREP tessellator: an
  `:axis-sweep` element with a `:rectangle` profile swept along a straight
  two-point axis (the common architectural case — a wall/beam extruded
  along a run with a rectangular cross-section; thickness is assumed
  horizontal-perpendicular to the axis, height straight up +Z). Every
  other geometry kind (brep, mesh-ref, non-rectangle axis-sweep profiles,
  no-geometry) exports as a plain `Xform` placeholder carrying only a
  `kotobaGeometryKind` string attr — a real limitation, not silently
  faked as a mesh.

  Environment presets (`:scene/atmosphere` `:scene/vegetation`
  `:scene/terrain` `:scene/postfx`) carry no placement/heightfield/
  instance data in M0's scene EDN (vegetation is a named-profile catalog
  with no positions, terrain is FBM generator CONFIG with no realized
  heightfield mesh) — so this namespace records each present domain as a
  `pr-str`'d custom string attr on an `Environment` `Scope` prim rather
  than fabricating geometry the data doesn't support.

  Material fidelity: `bim`'s `material-layer` carries a material NAME
  only, no color/roughness/PBR values — there's no real data to drive
  per-material MaterialX surfaces from. [[default-material-mtlx]] emits
  one neutral-gray `standard_surface` as a companion `.mtlx` document
  (satisfying ADR-2607100100 D5's `usd`+`materialx` pairing with a real,
  tested MaterialX artifact) — this namespace does NOT yet wire a
  verified USD<->MaterialX binding schema into the `.usda` stage itself
  (UsdMtlx `material:binding` conventions are nontrivial enough that
  guessing at them risks a binding that's silently wrong in a viewer;
  left as a real, documented gap rather than a guessed implementation)."
